# Learn a useful language

I bought this domain on Nov. 19, 2024, give me a couple of days to cook up some
examples.

## It's not just me

## You should know

This site is built with:

- [Soupault](https://github.com/pataphysicalsociety/soupault): static site
  generator written in OCaml
- [Pandoc](https://github.com/jgm/pandoc): universal markup converter written in
  Haskell
- [Nix](https://github.com/nixos/nix): purely functional package manager written
  in C++

Don't say it's a good language for teaching functional programming paradigm,
there are plenty good alternatives.

There's exactly 0 production-ready and widely-used software written in Racket
that I know since the very beginning of my programming journey (~9 years ago).
Prove me wrong.

## Thoughts?

Comrades? Say hi!

Racket lovers? Do your worst.

```shell
echo -n 'YnJhY2tldHNAcmt0LmxvbAo=' | base64 --decode
```
